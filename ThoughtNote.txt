In header component added code for the navbar using the Bootstrap 5 and edited some contents like brand image and text for the link tag.

HomeCover.js:
In homecover component I have added banner for the website which will display different image for different screen sizes.

And in slider component I have combined Bootstrap card with carousel to display image slider and placed the image as links from the google.

And the carousel was added with different content for different screen sizes.

Home.js:
In home component, all the 4 components are included to display them as a single page.

App.js:
